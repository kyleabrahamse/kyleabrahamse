# Hi, I'm Kyle! 👋

I'm a front-end developer with expertise in React and Typescript. I specialise in leveraging Next.js to optimise runtime performance and enhance user experiences. I also have experience working with Redux to manage complex application state, and have used Firebase for backend services. Currently, I'm diving into the world of testing with Jest and Vitest to ensure robust and reliable codebases.

🔭 I’m currently working on: Learning Redux, Vitest, and Jest
