<h1>Hi, I'm Kyle</h1> 

I'm a front-end developer with expertise in React, Next.js, and Firebase. I leverage these technologies to optimize runtime performance and enhance user experiences. Currently, I'm diving into the world of testing with Jest and Vitest to ensure robust and reliable codebases. Additionally, I'm learning Redux to effectively manage state in complex applications.
